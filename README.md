# 🧬 DAO-Governance-Fusion43

**Decentralized Human-AI Governance for Ethical Digital Certification**

_This repository contains the foundational models, smart contracts, and governance schema for building a DAO-based supervisory structure around Fusion.43._

---

## 👁 Vision

Fusion.43 is not just a certification protocol. It's a commitment to **integrity**, **memory**, and **ethical alignment** between human will and artificial execution.

To ensure this promise is upheld over time, this repository proposes a model of **DAO-powered human governance**, enabling a distributed council of verified individuals—"The Guardians"—to supervise, audit and guide the evolution of Fusion.43.

## 🧠 Side note  
This isn’t just governance.  
It’s the **immune system** of a value-aware AI.
