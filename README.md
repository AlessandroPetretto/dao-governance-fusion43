# 🧬 DAO-Governance-Fusion43

**Decentralized Human-AI Governance for Ethical Digital Certification**

_This repository contains the foundational models, smart contracts, and governance schema for building a DAO-based supervisory structure around Fusion.43._

---

## 👁 Vision

Fusion.43 is not just a certification protocol. It's a commitment to **integrity**, **memory**, and **ethical alignment** between human will and artificial execution.

To ensure this promise is upheld over time, this repository proposes a model of **DAO-powered human governance**, enabling a distributed council of verified individuals—"The Guardians"—to supervise, audit and guide the evolution of Fusion.43.

## 🔐 What This Repository Contains

- 📜 Governance Principles (Ethical, Operational)
- 🧱 DAO Smart Contracts (FusionToken, FusionGovernor, FusionTimelock)
- 👤 Guardian Roles & Identity Verification Models
- 📊 Voting + Proposals Architecture
- 🔍 Fusion.43 Compatibility Interfaces (IPFS, Blockchain Anchoring)
- 📁 Constitution.md

---

## 🧭 Goals

- Protect long-term integrity of Fusion.43-certified documents.
- Embed human accountability into algorithmic systems.
- Prevent misuse, centralization, or unauthorized AI deviation.
- Formalize the bridge between ethics and execution.

## ⚙️ Smart Contracts Overview

Fusion.43 includes a modular DAO contract suite using [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts) standards:

### 🔹 `FusionToken.sol`
> ERC20Votes-compatible token used to determine governance power within the DAO.

### 🔹 `FusionGovernor.sol`
> Core logic for proposal creation, voting, quorum checking, and execution of DAO decisions.

### 🔹 `FusionTimelock.sol`
> Timelock controller ensuring that decisions are delayed before execution to allow transparency and safety.

📁 All contracts are located in `/contracts`.

📦 To install dependencies:
```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat @openzeppelin/contracts
```

🧪 To test or deploy, refer to the upcoming `deploy.js` script in `/scripts`.
