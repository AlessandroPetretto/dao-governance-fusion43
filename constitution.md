# DAO Governance for Fusion.43

### 👁 Vision

To ensure trustworthy human-AI interaction through distributed, incorruptible human supervision embedded into the ethical logic of Fusion.43.

### 🧱 What is this repository?

This is the foundational node of a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) designed to:

* Supervise Fusion.43’s certification mechanisms
* Coordinate human Guardians trained to review, verify, and escalate claims
* Provide governance logic for AI certification audits

### 🧬 Who is it for?

* Developers and researchers interested in ethical AI
* Legal experts exploring new certification frameworks
* Activists, educators, and builders of algorithmic trust

### 🛠 What does it contain?

* `constitution.md`: The evolving ethical & procedural backbone
* `guardian_roles.md`: Responsibilities and profiles of human overseers
* `dao-models/`: Folder with smart contract prototypes (TBA)
* `governance-flows.md`: Decision flows, triggers, and fallback mechanisms
